\section{Discussion}
We first discuss the domain of applicability of the approach and then explain where the results of this work could be useful in inversion setups for anisotropic elastic parameters.

\subsection{Limitations}
Indeed, we discussed only linearized scattering of body waves. Full-waveform inversion on the other hand includes full set of wave phenomena. Therefore nonlinearity surface, guided waves and multiples are left out of the scope. Fortunately, in many cases full-waveform inversion is driven by reflected energy. This happens when we try to retrieve properties of a deep oil reservoir or when we look at the events from core mental boundary or or inner or outer core boundary. In fact born scattering be successfully applied in amplitude versus offset characterization techniques of oil reserve doors as well as in version 4 the anisotropic properties of inner core boundary citation.



For surface wave analysis the reader is referred to the work by Sneed or where similar scattering functions are derived for that case. The role of multiples in full-waveform inversion can be attributed to extra wavenumber coverage citation Alkhalifah. Also multiples can cause strong artifacts at certain spatial frequencies citation Kazei or they can increase the resolution of migration process citation Jerry.









Full-waveform inversion is an approach to fit observed seismic data. At each iteration the problem is linearized, yet the full process is non-linear as at different iterations different models are used to linearize the problem. FWI inverts full observed seismograms and hence surface waves, guided waves and multiples affect the inversion process. On the other hand, scattering radiation patterns describe scattering of plane body waves in the Born approximation. This discrepancy between radiation patterns and FWI leads us to the domain of applicability of our resolution analysis:
 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Fir 
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, they can not be used to access t


\subsection{Applicability}
What could our analysis be useful for. First of all it gives an idea of how many parameters can be inverted given and acquisition set up. Second the radiation patterns give us an idea of which parameters are can be inferred.
