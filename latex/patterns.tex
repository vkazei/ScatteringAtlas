\section{Scattering radiation patterns of elastic parameters}

Here, we give a brief history of patterns and then describe them mathematically.
We start the mathematical description with the scattering function introduced by \cite{eaton1994}, which describes the scattering of arbitrary plane waves on a point scatterer, and we discuss its reduction to diffraction-based 
\citep{wu1985,tarantola1986} and reflection-based 
\citep{gholami20131,alkhalifah2014} scattering radiation patterns.
