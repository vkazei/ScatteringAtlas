  abstract = {We successfully apply the acoustic Laplace?Fourier waveform tomography method to delineate P-wave velocity structures of the mega-splay fault system in the central part of the seismogenic Nankai subduction zone offshore Japan, using densely sampled wide-angle ocean bottom seismograph (OBS) data originally acquired in 2004. Our success is due to new and carefully designed data preconditioning and inversion strategies to mitigate (i) the well-known non-linearity of waveform inversion, (ii) the challenges arising from crustal-scale survey designs (e.g. undersampling of the OBSs), and (iii) modelling errors due to the use of the acoustic assumption.We identify a sixfold set of key components that together lead to the success of the high-resolution waveform tomography image: (i) Availability of low-frequency components (starting at 2.25?Hz) reducing the non-linearity, and access to large offset data (up to 55?km) increasing the depth of illumination and the recovery of low wavenumber components. (ii) A highly accurate traveltime tomography result (with an rms error of approximately 60?ms) that further mitigates the non-linearity. (iii) A hierarchical inversion approach in which phase spectra are inverted first to reduce artefacts from the acoustic assumption, and amplitude information is only incorporated in the final stages. (iv) A Laplace?Fourier domain approach that facilitates a multiscale approach to mitigate non-linearity by restricting the inversion to the low frequency components and early arrivals first, and sequentially including higher frequencies and later arrivals. (v) A pre-conditioning strategy for eliminating undesirable high wavenumber components from the the gradient. (vi) A strategy for source estimation that reduce the influence of the instrumental design.In the OBS case study used for illustration purposes, Laplace?Fourier waveform tomography retrieves velocity anomalies as small as 700?m (horizontally) and 350?m (vertically) above the top of the Philippine Sea Plate. The resulting velocity structures include low-velocity zones and thrust structures which have not been previously identified clearly. The velocity models are validated by scrutiny of synthetic and observed waveforms, by evaluating the coherency of source estimates, and by comparison with 3-D pre-stack migrated (PreSDM) images. Chequerboard tests and point-scatter tests demonstrate both the reliability and the limitations of the acoustic implementation.},

  volume = {202},
  doi = {10.1093/gji/ggv228},
  abstract = {Full waveform inversion (FWI) aims to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface models from the full wavefield, which includes diving waves, post-critical reflections and short-spread reflections. Most successful applications of FWI are driven by the information carried by diving waves and post-critical reflections to build the long-to-intermediate wavelengths of the velocity structure. Alternative approaches, referred to as reflection waveform inversion (RWI), have been recently revisited to retrieve these long-to-intermediate wavelengths from short-spread reflections by using some prior knowledge of the reflectivity and a scale separation between the velocity macromodel and the reflectivity. This study presents a unified formalism of FWI, named as Joint FWI, whose aim is to efficiently combine the diving and reflected waves for velocity model building. The two key ingredients of Joint FWI are, on the data side, the explicit separation between the short-spread reflections and the wide-angle arrivals and, on the model side, the scale separation between the velocity macromodel and the short-scale impedance model. The velocity model and the impedance model are updated in an alternate way by Joint FWI and waveform inversion of the reflection data (least-squares migration), respectively. Starting from a crude velocity model, Joint FWI is applied to the streamer seismic data computed in the synthetic Valhall model. While the conventional FWI is stuck into a local minimum due to cycle skipping, Joint FWI succeeds in building a reliable velocity macromodel. Compared with RWI, the use of diving waves in Joint FWI improves the reconstruction of shallow velocities, which translates into an improved imaging at deeper depths. The smooth velocity model built by Joint FWI can be subsequently used as a reliable initial model for conventional FWI to increase the high-wavenumber content of the velocity model.},

  abstract = {The approximate ray Green's tensor in 3-D heterogeneous elastic media combined with the first-order Born approximation lead to new explicit equations for solving, modelling and inverse scattering problems. Individual wave scattering contributions (PP, PS, SP, SS) are represented for four different linear approximations (i.e. parameter linearizations). the first-order Born appoximation yields a scattered wavefield which is linearly related to medium parameter perturbations. the linearized inverse scattering problem is solved in the space-time domain and consists of minimizing a cost function within the l2 norm with a one-step conditioned gradient procedure. From uni- or multicomponent data and a reference heterogeneous background model representing adequately either the long spatial wavelengths of the medium (i.e. the smooth model), and/or its principal features (i.e. the macro-model), this operation reduces to: (1) pre-stack depth-migrating the scattered data yielding three intermediate images; and (2) deconvolving these images by an elastic Hessian correction which produces final high-resolution images representing the medium's short spatial wavelength variations convolved with the source function (e.g. P and S impedances and density maps). If the reference model and data are satisfactory, typical artefacts are due to limited aperture or insufficient coverage. Use of high-frequency and Born approximations require certain constraints. For example, the dominant wavelength must always be smaller than the characteristic length of the reference medium, but larger than the scatterer characteristic length. to increase computational efficiency, the high-frequency approximate Green's tensor is calculated by the paraxial ray method. 2-D elastic synthetic examples for surface reflection and cross-hole experiments show the ability of such a technique to delineate subsurface structure and to recover local changes in elastic properties. However, density variations are more difficult to resolve than P and S impedance or velocity changes.},

  abstract = {A Fourier or pseudospectral forward-modeling algorithm for solving the two-dimensional acoustic wave equation is presented. The method utilizes a spatial numerical grid to calculate spatial derivatives by the fast Fourier transform. Time derivatives which appear in the wave equation are calculated by second-order differencing. The scheme requires fewer grid points than finite-difference methods to achieve the same accuracy. It is therefore believed that the Fourier method will prove more efficient than finite-difference methods, especially when dealing with three-dimensional models.The Fourier forward-modeling method was tested against two problems, a single-layer problem with a known analytic solution and a wedge problem which was also tested by physical modeling. The numerical results agreed with both the analytic and physical model results. Furthermore, the numerical model facilitates the explanation of certain events on the time section of the physical model which otherwise could not easily be taken into account.},

  abstract = {Wave-equation traveltime tomography tries to obtain a subsurface velocity model from seismic data, either passive or active, that explains their traveltimes. A key step is the extraction of traveltime differences, or relative phase shifts, between observed and modelled finite-frequency waveforms. A standard approach involves a correlation of the observed and measured waveforms. When the amplitude spectra of the waveforms are identical, the maximum of the correlation is indicative of the relative phase shift. When the amplitude spectra are not identical, however, this argument is no longer valid. We propose an alternative criterion to measure the relative phase shift. This misfit criterion is a weighted norm of the correlation and is less sensitive to differences in the amplitude spectra. For practical application it is important to use a sensitivity kernel that is consistent with the way the misfit is measured. We derive this sensitivity kernel and show how it differs from the standard banana\dbend{}doughnut sensitivity kernel. We illustrate the approach on a cross-well data set.},

  doi = {10.1093/gji/ggt258},
  abstract = {Wave equation based inversions, such as full-waveform inversion and reverse-time migration, are challenging because of their computational costs, memory requirements and reliance on accurate initial models. To confront these issues, we propose a novel formulation of wave equation based inversion based on a penalty method. In this formulation, the objective function consists of a data-misfit term and a penalty term, which measures how accurately the wavefields satisfy the wave equation. This new approach is a major departure from current formulations where forward and adjoint wavefields, which both satisfy the wave equation, are correlated to compute updates for the unknown model parameters. Instead, we carry out the inversions over two alternating steps during which we first estimate the wavefield everywhere, given the current model parameters, source and observed data, followed by a second step during which we update the model parameters, given the estimate for the wavefield everywhere and the source. Because the inversion involves both the synthetic wavefields and the medium parameters, its search space is enlarged so that it suffers less from local minima. Compared to other formulations that extend the search space of wave equation based inversion, our method differs in several aspects, namely (i) it avoids storage and updates of the synthetic wavefields because we calculate these explicitly by finding solutions that obey the wave equation and fit the observed data and (ii) no adjoint wavefields are required to update the model, instead our updates are calculated from these solutions directly, which leads to significant computational savings. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by carefully selected examples and discuss possible extensions and future research.},

  abstract = {Iterative inversion methods have been unsuccessful at inverting seismic data obtained from complicated earth models (e.g. the Marmousi model), the primary difficulty being the presence of numerous local minima in the objective function. The presence of local minima at all scales in the seismic inversion problem prevent iterative methods of inversion from attaining a reasonable degree of convergence to the neighborhood of the global minimum. The multigrid method is a technique that improves the performance of iterative inversion by decomposing the problem by scale. At long scales there are fewer local minima and those that remain are further apart from each other. Thus, at long scales iterative methods can get closer to the neighborhood of the global minimum. We apply the multigrid method to a subsampled, low-frequency version of the Marmousi data set. Although issues of source estimation, source bandwidth, and noise are not treated, results show that iterative inversion methods perform much better when employed with a decomposition by scale. Furthermore, the method greatly reduces the computational burden of the inversion that will be of importance for 3-D extensions to the method.},

In anisotropic media, the non-linearity becomes far more complex with the potential trade-off between the multiparameter description of the model. A gradient filter helps us in accessing the parts of the gradient that are suitable to combat the potential non-linearity and parameter trade-off. The filter is based on representing the gradient in the time-lag normalized domain, in which the low scattering angle of the gradient update is initially muted out in the FWI implementation, in what we may refer to as a scattering angle continuation process. The result is a low wavelength update dominated by the transmission part of the update gradient. In this case, even 10 Hz data can produce vertically near-zero wavenumber updates suitable for a background correction of the model. Relaxing the filtering at a later stage in the FWI implementation allows for smaller scattering angles to contribute higher-resolution information to the model. The benefits of the extended domain based filtering of the gradient is not only it's ability in providing low wavenumber gradients guided by the scattering angle, but also in its potential to provide gradients free of unphysical energy that may correspond to unrealistic scattering angles.},

  abstract = {We present a wave-equation-based method for seismic illumination analysis. A one-way wave-equation-based, generalized screen propagator is used to extrapolate the wavefields from sources and receivers to the subsurface target. A local plane-wave analysis is used at the target to calculate localized, directional energy fluxes for both source and receiver wavefields. We construct an illumination matrix using these energy fluxes to quantify the target illumination conditions. The target geometry information is used to manipulate the illumination matrix and generate different types of illumination measures. The wave-equation-based approach can properly handle forward multiple-scattering phenomena, including focusing/defocusing, diffraction, and interference effects. It can be directly applied to complex velocity models. Velocity-model smoothing and Fresnel-zone smoothing are not required. Different illumination measurements derived from this method can be applied to target-oriented or volumetric illumination analyses. This new method is flexible and practical for illumination analysis in complex 2D and 3D velocity models with nontrivial acquisition and target geometries.},

Often, this can be attributed to strong interference effects from neighboring reflection coefficients of the classical type (i.e., parameter discontinuities or jumps). However, an intrinsic frequency dependence from a single layer is possible if the contact is not a jump discontinuity but a gradual transition. We have expanded the normal-incidence theory of a linear velocity transition zone (termed a Wolf ramp) and have shown how it leads to frequency-dependent reflectivity. The development of waveform forward modeling in turn has led to a ramp detection method that we have tested on migrated field data.},

The sources are relocated using the 1968 tables of Herrin et al. Precursors to PP, called PdP, are widely reported up to about 85s before PP; few are reported at earlier times. These independent observations provide further evidence that, above a depth of at least 400 km, the upper mantle contains structural discontinuities (perhaps due to phase changes) on a global scale. PKiKP waves (reflections from the inner core) are traceable in this data sample back to 106$^\circ$. The result is consistent with a sharp inner core boundary at 1220km radius. Observed PKP travel times near 113$^\circ$ are closely consistent with PKIKP times derived by Bolt for use with the 1968 P tables of Herrin et al.; the observed times for $\Delta$ $<$ 113$^\circ$ are about 0.5 s later than predicted. Travel times (for 100 km focal depth and 102$^\circ$ $<$ $\Delta$ $<$ 110$^\circ$) of the PcP wave which is diffracted into the shadow of the core fit the curve t= (14m 02.8$\pm$;0.14s)+(4.60$\pm$0.05 s/deg)($\Delta$\textendash{}106$^\circ$.45). This result leads to a radius for the Earth's core of 3479$\pm$2km; there is an indication that the P velocity may decrease by a few per cent at the base of the mantle.},

These waves follow a path similar to that of the inner-core\textendash{}reflected waves PKiKP and were originally observed in data from 16 events in the distance range 58$^\circ$ to 73$^\circ$ recorded by the Large Aperture Seismic Array (LASA). Here we present additional observations of the ICS waves from a total of 78 events recorded by LASA at distances from 18$^\circ$ to 98$^\circ$. We use a modified version of the Generic Array Processing software package to identify ICS waves on the basis of travel time, back azimuth, ray parameter, amplitude, and coherence. There are 44 events that produce clear ICS waves. We then perform forward modeling of the observed ICS waves using a Monte Carlo seismic phonon method that allows for multiple scattering along the raypath. Most of the ICS waves appear without a visible PKiKP phase, initially grow in time, and have a spindle-shaped envelope. The duration, risetime, and decay rates of the observed ICS waves can be best explained by small-scale volumetric heterogeneities in the outermost few hundred kilometers of the inner core. The average Qc value for the 44 events is $\sim$600. Most clear ICS waves are found for raypaths sampling the Pacific Ocean and Asia, and relatively few observations are from the Atlantic Ocean, roughly consistent with the recently observed hemispheric difference in the inner-core structure.},

  abstract = {Frequency-dependent reflection coefficients of P waves at the inner core boundary (ICB) are estimated from the spectral ratios of PKiKP and PcP waves observed by the high-sensitivity seismograph network (Hi-net) in Japan. The corresponding PKiKP reflection locations at the ICB are distributed beneath the western Pacific. At frequencies where noise levels are sufficiently low, spectra of reflection coefficients show four distinct sets of characteristics: a flat spectrum, a spectrum with a significant spectral hole at approximately 1 or 3~Hz, a spectrum with a strong peak at approximately 2 or 3~Hz, and a spectrum containing both a sharp peak and a significant hole. The variety in observed spectra suggests complex lateral variations in ICB properties. To explain the measured differences in frequency characteristics of ICB reflection coefficients, we conduct 2D finite difference simulations of seismic wavefields near the ICB. The models tested in our simulations include a liquid layer and a solid layer above the ICB, as well as sinusoidal and spike-shaped ICB topography with varying heights and scale lengths. We find that the existence of a layer above the ICB can be excluded as a possible explanation for the observed spectra. Furthermore, we find that an ICB topographic model with wavelengths and heights of several kilometers is too extreme to explain our measurements. However, restricting the ICB topography to wavelengths and heights of 1.0\textendash{}1.5~km can explain the observed frequency-related phenomena. The existence of laterally varying topography may be a sign of lateral variations in inner core solidification.},

We have collected PKiKP recorded at short distances ($<$45$^\circ$) at broadband stations in Australia and at the Warramunga seismic array (WRA). Despite potential complications from a dual-passage through D${''}$, PKiKP is frequently observed on single traces in the frequency band 1\textendash{}5Hz. PKiKP usually has a sharp onset, but sometimes its waveforms have multiple pulses separated by times of the order of 1s. At WRA, the coda of PKiKP initially decays very rapidly after the main pulse. Thereafter, its amplitude is nearly constant and more than three times smaller than PKiKP with duration longer than 200s. Our observations differ from those of [Nature 404 (2000) 273\textendash{}275], at rather greater distances, who found that the coda is larger than PKiKP and increases slowly. We suggest that the PKiKP coda is generated near the inner core boundary by complex reverberation effects, rather than scattering through the volume of the inner core.},

  abstract = {The inner core boundary (ICB), where melting and solidification of the core occur, plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the Earth's interior. To probe temporal changes near the ICB beneath the eastern hemisphere, I analyze differential times of PKiKP (dt(PKiKP)), double differential times of PKiKP-PKPdf, and PKiKP coda waves from repeating earthquakes in the southwest Pacific subduction zones. dt(PKiKP) values are mostly within $\pm$30\,ms of one another, without systematic temporal dependence. Some observations of PKiKP coda waves have absolute time shifts of $>$50\,ms relative to their main phases. The combination of temporal changes in PKiKP coda arrivals and negligible changes in PKiKP arrivals favors a smooth ICB with fine-scale structures in the upper inner core. dt(PKiKP) values are interpreted in the context of melting- or growth-induced ICB topography, based on dynamic models. Uncertainties in dt(PKiKP) prevent verification of ICB melting or growth on decadal time scales.},

  abstract = {Mathematically, 21 stiffnesses arranged in a 6 \texttimes{} 6 symmetric matrix completely describe the elastic properties of any homogeneous anisotropic medium, regardless of symmetry system and orientation. However, it can be difficult in practice to characterize an anisotropic medium's properties merely from casual inspection of its (often experimentally measured) stiffness matrix. For characterization purposes, it is better to decompose a measured stiffness matrix into a stiffness matrix for a canonically oriented transversely isotropic (TI) medium (whose properties can be readily understood) plus a generally anisotropic perturbation (representing the medium's deviation from perfect symmetry), followed by a rotation (giving the relationship between the medium's natural coordinate system and the measurement coordinate system). To accomplish this decomposition, we must find the rotated symmetric medium that best approximates a given stiffness matrix. An analytical formula exists for calculating the distance between the elastic properties of two anisotropic media. Starting from this formula, I show how to analytically calculate the TI medium with a zz$<$math display="inline" overflow="scroll"$><$mrow$><$mi$>$z$<$/mi$><$/mrow$><$/math$>$ symmetry axis that is nearest to a given set of 21 stiffness constants. There is no known analytical result if the symmetry axis is not fixed beforehand. I therefore present a simple search algorithm that scans all possible orientations of the nearest TI medium's symmetry axis. The grid is iteratively refined to optimize the solution. The algorithm is simple and robust and works well in practice, but it is not guaranteed to always find the optimal global answer if there are secondary minima that provide almost as good a fit as the optimal one.},

  abstract = {We have developed and implemented a robust and practical scheme for anisotropic 3D acoustic full-waveform inversion (FWI). We demonstrate this scheme on a field data set, applying it to a 4C ocean-bottom survey over the Tommeliten Alpha field in the North Sea. This shallow-water data set provides good azimuthal coverage to offsets of 7~km, with reduced coverage to a maximum offset of about 11~km. The reservoir lies at the crest of a high-velocity antiformal chalk section, overlain by about 3000~m of clastics within which a low-velocity gas cloud produces a seismic obscured area. We inverted only the hydrophone data, and we retained free-surface multiples and ghosts within the field data. We invert in six narrow frequency bands, in the range 3 to 6.5~Hz. At each iteration, we selected only a subset of sources, using a different subset at each iteration; this strategy is more efficient than inverting all the data every iteration. Our starting velocity model was obtained using standard PSDM model building including anisotropic reflection tomography, and contained epsilon values as high as 20\%. The final FWI velocity model shows a network of shallow high-velocity channels that match similar features in the reflection data. Deeper in the section, the FWI velocity model reveals a sharper and more-intense low-velocity region associated with the gas cloud in which low-velocity fingers match the location of gas-filled faults visible in the reflection data. The resulting velocity model provides a better match to well logs, and better flattens common-image gathers, than does the starting model. Reverse-time migration, using the FWI velocity model, provides significant uplift to the migrated image, simplifying the planform of the reservoir section at depth. The workflows, inversion strategy, and algorithms that we have used have broad application to invert a wide-range of analogous data sets.},

It is based on two foundations continuum mechanics of elastic media and the general principles of scattering theory. There is a wide body of literature on elastodynamic wave scattering. A comprehensive overview of scattering of acoustic, electromagnetic, and elastic waves are presented in a unified way. The propagation of elastic waves forms the foundation of seismology. An outline is given on the principles of elasticity that are relevant for elastic wave scattering. In elasticity theory, the Green's function gives the displacement generated by a point force in a certain direction. Since both the point force and the displacement are vectors with three components, the Green's function is a 3 x 3 tensor. To describe scattering, it is necessary to define a reference medium in which an unperturbed wave propagates and a perturbation of the medium that acts as a secondary source generates scattered waves. For this reason, the elasticity tensor c is divided into a reference tensor c(0) and a perturbation c(1).},

Full-waveform inversion, therefore, has the potential to provide a more accurate result compared with conventional processing methods. We present a feasibility study with results of the application of high-frequency (up to 60 Hz) anisotropic elastic full-waveform inversion to a walkaway vertical seismic profile data from the Arabian Gulf. Full-waveform inversion has reproduced the majority of the wave events and recovered a geologically plausible layered model with physically meaningful values of the medium.},

  abstract = {An amplitude-preserving anisotropic migration formula is derived in this paper. The migration is viewed as a weighted diffraction stack and the migration weights are estimated with the stationary phase theorem. To obtain a formula easy to implement, the weights are written in terms of quantities computable along the rays. A sensitivity analysis is then carried out to show that, in the vertical transverse isotropic case, the amplitude-preserving migration is mainly governed by two parameters: the anisotropic NMO velocity and the parameter $\eta$. These parameters can be estimated from the data with a velocity (background) analysis. Therefore, it is possible to use this amplitude-preserving anisotropic migration to recover the correct amplitudes versus offset or azimuth in the migrated image.},

  abstract = {Multiple vertical fracture sets, possibly combined with horizontal fine layering, produce an equivalent medium of monoclinic symmetry with a horizontal symmetry plane. Although monoclinic models may be rather common for fractured formations, they have hardly been used in seismic methods of fracture detection due to the large number of independent elements in the stiffness tensor. Here, we show that multicomponent wide-azimuth reflection data (combined with known vertical velocity or reflector depth) or multi-azimuth walkaway VSP surveys provide enough information to invert for all but one anisotropic parameters of monoclinic media. In order to facilitate the inversion procedure, we introduce a Thomsen-style parametrization for monoclinic media that includes the vertical velocities of the P-wave and one of the split S-waves and a set of dimensionless anisotropic coefficients. Our notation, defined for the coordinate frame associated with the polarization directions of the vertically propagating shear waves, captures the combinations of the stiffnesses responsible for the normal-moveout (NMO) ellipses of all three pure modes. The first group of the anisotropic parameters contains seven coefficients ($\epsilon$(1,2), $\delta$(1,2,3) and $\gamma$(1,2)) analogous to those defined by Tsvankin for the higher-symmetry orthorhombic model. The parameters $\epsilon$(1,2), $\delta$(1,2) and $\gamma$(1,2) are primarily responsible for the pure-mode NMO velocities along the coordinate axes x1 and x2 (i.e. in the shear-wave polarization directions). The remaining coefficient $\delta$(3) is not constrained by conventional-spread reflection traveltimes in a horizontal monoclinic layer. The second parameter group consists of the newly introduced coefficients $\zeta$(1,2,3) which control the rotation of the P-, S1- and S2-wave NMO ellipses with respect to the horizontal coordinate axes. Misalignment of the P-wave NMO ellipse and shear-wave polarization directions was recently observed on field data by P\'erez et al. Our parameter-estimation algorithm, based on NMO equations valid for any strength of the anisotropy, is designed to obtain anisotropic parameters of monoclinic media by inverting the vertical velocities and NMO ellipses of the P-, S1- and S2-waves. A Dix-type representation of the NMO velocity of mode-converted waves makes it possible to replace the pure shear modes in reflection surveys with the PS1- and PS2-waves. Numerical tests show that our method yields stable estimates of all relevant parameters for both a single layer and a horizontally stratified monoclinic medium.},

We further developed FWI to obtain multi-parameter images at high resolution. Here, we involve physical parameters, such as velocities and attenuation of seismic waves as well as mass density, which are essential for a reliable petrophysical characterization of subsurface structures in hydrocarbon exploration, geotechnical applications and underground constructions. Referring to this, we successfully applied FWI to field datasets recorded in the Black Sea and in the shallow-water area of a river delta in the Atlantic Ocean. We obtained detailed subsurface images containing rock formations which might be potential gas deposits. Additionally, we performed synthetic studies as preparatory steps to verify methodological improvements for further field-data applications. Here, we demonstrate resolution capabilities of FWI for imaging geological structures beneath salt bodies, investigate strategies to recover attenuation information from seismic data and perform a joint inversion of surface waves to image the very shallow subsurface.},

Waveform inversion directly fits the waveform of observed data, and it can be applied to any kinds of earth models. We have used the Love-wave waveform inversion in the time domain to estimate near-surface S-wave velocity. We used the finite-difference method as the forward modeling method. The source effect was removed by the deconvolution technique, which made our method independent of the source wavelet. We defined the difference between the deconvolved observed and calculated waveform as the misfit function. We divided the model into different sizes of blocks depending on the resolution of the Love waves, and we updated the S-wave velocity of each block via a conjugate gradient algorithm. We used two synthetic models to test the effectiveness of our method. A real-world case verified the validity of our method.},

The scattering and mode conversion coefficients are shown for scattering of surface waves by the root of an Alpine-like crustal structure. Furthermore a `great circle theorem' in a plane geometry is derived. A new proof of Snell's law is given for surface wave scattering by a quarter-space. It is shown how a stationary phase approximation can be used to simplify the Fourier synthesis of the scattered wave in the time domain.

Statistical methods are essential in order to be able to take into account the limited, uncertain nature of the observations. It can be seen that the classical imaging methods of seismology and ultrasonics (such as migration and diffraction tomography) arise as special cases of more general waveform inversion formulae. The methods described are applicable in many fields that make use of array-based waveform measurements, such as ultrasonics, nondestructive testing, global seismology, ocean acoustics and ground-penetrating radar. Seismic migration is applied in vast quantities of exploration seismic data around the world; it can be looked upon as a special case of a more general family of waveform inversion algorithms. The goal of migration is to produce maps of the subsurface reflection coefficient. Migration is used as a form of exploratory data analysis. On the other hand, the goal of seismic waveform inversion is to make quantitative inferences about the Earth's elastic properties. The final result consists of probabilistic statements about the range of models that fit the surface seismic data and are statistically consistent with the borehole measurements.},

  doi = {10.1093/gji/ggv435},
  abstract = {An asymmetry between a nearly isotropic, faster `eastern' hemisphere and an anisotropic, slower `western' hemisphere in Earth's inner core has been revealed by previous seismic studies. However, it remains unclear if division of the inner core into just two hemispheres is too simplistic. Here, we carry out regional-scale tomography using a new body wave data set to study the hemisphere boundary region beneath the northern and central Pacific Ocean and North America. If anisotropy is not considered, then a hemispherical pattern seems to be present in the study region, though the hemisphere boundary appears to be irregular. However, once the presence of anisotropy is permitted we find that this region cannot be simply separated into an anisotropic western hemisphere and an isotropic eastern hemisphere; instead the strength of the anisotropy varies regionally. The global hemispherical pattern is not observed here, instead the strongest anisotropy is observed in the centre and south west of the study region. Some of the strongest anisotropy appears to be in the `eastern' inner core, while part of the inner core assumed to be in the western hemisphere shows weaker anisotropy. Thus, this part of the inner core displays complex variations in anisotropy which differ from a simple hemispherical division. We suggest that a long-lived global heterogeneity, such as uneven heat flow through the core\textendash{}mantle boundary over a period of hundreds of millions of years, may be responsible for the observed pattern of inner core anisotropy.},

  abstract = {Significant lateral and depth variations of the inner core's properties, such as the large-scale hemispherical pattern, have been confirmed by a variety of seismological observations. However it is still unclear which dynamic processes in the core are responsible for these variations. Small-scale volumetric heterogeneity has been detected in the top layer of the inner core by PKiKP coda observations. Studies of these small-scale heterogeneities can provide critical information, such as the degree of alignment of iron crystals, the presence of possible partial melt and the grain size of iron crystals, all of which can be used to constrain the dynamic processes of the inner core. However, most previous observations sampled the inner core beneath the Pacific Ocean and Asia, often in the inner core's `eastern hemisphere'. We use seismic stations in the North America, including the Earthscope Transportable Array, to look at PKiKP and its coda waves. We find 21 events with clear signals. In agreement with previous studies, inner core scattering (ICS), resulting in clear PKiKP coda, is found at epicentral distances of 60$^\circ$\textendash{}95$^\circ$. However, the ICS we observe in these 21 western hemisphere events is weaker than previously reported for the eastern hemisphere. Comparing our observations with numerical simulations, we conclude that this relatively weak ICS indicates small-scale heterogeneity in at least the top layer of the inner core beneath Central America. Combining our clear observations with previous studies suggests either a hemispherical difference, or a regional variation, of small-scale heterogeneity in the inner core.},

  abstract = {Seismic anisotropy is an important tool for studying the nature, origin and dynamics of the lowermost mantle (D${''}$). We introduce differential S\textendash{}ScS splitting as a tool for removing the effect of near-source and near-receiver anisotropy to estimate splitting accrued in the D${''}$ region. This is applicable to events recorded at epicentral distances between 60$^\circ$ and 85$^\circ$. Near-source anisotropy has often been ignored in previous studies of lowermost mantle anisotropy. We apply differential S\textendash{}ScS splitting to records from Canadian National Seismic Network stations of western Pacific earthquakes; these sample the lowermost mantle beneath the north Pacific. The residual splitting in ScS, which we attribute to D${''}$, shows lag times between 1.0 and 3.9 s. Given the near horizontal ray path of ScS in D${''}$, we interpret the recovered fast directions as the orientation of the fast shear wave in the plane defined by the vertical and transverse directions and observe a clearly non-VTI (transverse isotropy with a vertical axis of symmetry) style of anisotropy. The largest population of results shows an approximately southeasterly dipping symmetry axis which we speculate might be explained by descending palaeoslab material being swept horizontally across the core\textendash{}mantle boundary towards an upwelling region beneath the central Pacific. Non-VTI symmetry and the many possible contributions to D${''}$ anisotropy from lower-mantle minerals, melt and subducted materials suggest that our understanding of the lowermost mantle could be greatly improved by trying to resolve a more general style of anisotropy.},

On entering an anisotropic zone a plane shear wave splits into two orthogonally polarized phases6; an effect observed by several researchers7, notably by Ando et al.5,8,9. The near vertical ScS wave, an S wave reflected once at the core-mantle boundary, is one of the most suitable phases to study the phenomenon of shear wave birefringence because it is isolated from other phases and because its particle motion is nearly horizontal and thus free from S to P conversion. The split ScS shear waves travel with different velocities in the anisotropic zone and consequently there is a time delay between their arrival at stations. My aim was to determine this time delay and the azimuth of polarization using the ScS records of two horizontal components from the Japanese islands for a deep shock beneath the Sea of Okhotsk. From the total of 41 stations 34 show a polarization of the maximum velocity phase in the NNW\textendash{}SSE direction with an average time advance of $\sim$0.8s from the minimum velocity phase.

  abstract = {We have made measurements of shear wave splitting in the phases SKS and SKKS at 21 broadband stations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Measurements are made using a retrieval scheme that yields the azimuth of the fast polarization direction $\phi$ and delay time $\delta$t of the split shear wave plus uncertainties. Detectable anisotropy was found at most stations, suggesting that it is a general feature of the subcontinental mantle. Delay times range from 0.65 s to 1.70 s and average about 1 s. Somewhat surprisingly, the largest delay time is found in the 2.7 b.y.-old Western Superior Province of the Canadian Shield. The splitting observations are interpreted in terms of the strain-induced lattice preferred orientation of mantle minerals, especially olivine. We consider three hypotheses concerning the origin of the continental anisotropy: (1) strain associated with absolute plate motion, as in the oceanic upper mantle, (2) crustal stress, and (3) the past and present internal deformation of the subcontinental upper mantle by tectonic episodes. It is found that the last hypothesis is the most successful, namely that the most recent significant episode of internal deformation appears to be the best predictor of $\phi$. For stable continental regions, this is interpreted as ``fossil'' anisotropy, whereas for presently active regions, such as Alaska, the anisotropy reflects present-day tectonic activity. In the stable portion of North America there is a good correlation between delay time and lithospheric thickness; this is consistent with the anisotropy being localized in the subcontinental lithosphere and suggests that intrinsic anisotropy is approximately constant. The acceptance of this hypothesis has several implications for subcontinental mantle deformation. First, it argues for coherent deformation of the continental lithosphere (crust and mantle) during orogenies. This implies that the anisotropic portion of the lithosphere was present since the deformational episode and rules out the addition of undeformed material to this layer by subsequent ``underplating'' or conductive growth of the thermal boundary layer. One of the most important issues in the study of orogenies is the need to reconcile the formation of thickened lithosphere with the paradoxically high mantle temperatures often associated with orogenic episodes. Most efforts to date have focussed on modes of deformation whereby the cold lithospheric mantle is removed (by convective instability or delamination) and replaced by warm asthenosphere. These models, however, are incompatible with the evidence for preserved coherent lithospheric deformation; rather, the deformed mantle appears to have been heated in place. We suggest that the elevated mantle temperatures may be due to the strain heating accompanying the deformation.},

Just like a good quarryman, a trained structural geologistwill detectapreferredorientationin an apparently isotropic granite.

Consideringthe largevariationsinelasticcoefficientsofrock-forming minerals, itcould be predicted that, in turn, seismic anisotropy should exist and be important, provided thatdomains withasimilarstructural signatureare largeenough to affectseismic waves. This is why, in 1982 at a conference held in Frankfurt, which was oneofthe fIrst meetings devoted to the subject of seismic anisotropy, I asked Don Anderson the question of why seismologists had not considered earlier in their models the obvious constraint of anisotropy. I still remember Don's answer: "Adolphe, we knew that our isotropic models were not very good but we had no other choice. It is simply that, so far, computerswere not largeenough tointegrate the anisotropy parameter." Changingisotropic glassesfor anisotropic ones permits us to obtain betterand more realistic seismic modelsofthe Earth's interior, but, maybe more importantly, it has, for a seismologist, the farreaching consequenceofsteppinginto the fIeld ofgeodynamics.},

Broadband seismic data of 146 and 131 teleseismic earthquake events recorded at DHN and BOKR stations during 2007\textendash{}2014 were analyzed for the present measurements. The study is carried out using rotation-correlation and transverse component minimization methods. We retain our ``Good'', ``Fair'' and ``Null'' measurements, and estimate the splitting parameters using 13 ``Good'' results for DHN and 10 ``Good'' results for BOKR stations. The average splitting parameters ($\phi$, $\delta$t) for DHN and BOKR stations are found to be 50.76$^\circ\pm$5.46$^\circ$ and 0.82~$\pm$~0.2~s and 56.30$^\circ\pm$5.07$^\circ$ and 0.95~$\pm$~0.17~s, and the estimated average thicknesses of the anisotropic layers beneath these two stations are~$\sim$~94 and $\sim$109~km, respectively. The measured deviation of azimuth of the fast axis direction ($\phi$) from the absolute motion of the Indian plate ranges from $\sim$8$^\circ$ to 14$^\circ$. The measured deviation of azimuth of the fast axis direction ($\phi$) from the absolute motion of the Indian plate ranges from $\sim$8$^\circ$ to 14$^\circ$. The eastward deviation of the fast axis azimuths from absolute plate motion direction is interpreted to be caused by induced outflow from the asthenosphere. Further, the delay time found in the present analysis is close to the global average for continental shield areas, and also coherent with other studies for Indian shield regions. The five ``Null'' results and the lower delay time of $\sim$0.5\textendash{}0.6~s might be indicating multilayer anisotropy existing in the mantle lithosphere beneath the study area.},

The directions of polarization of the fast quasi-shear wave and the time delays between the quasi-shear waves are obtained at nearly 70 locations in all continents, except Antarctica. These data are interpreted in terms of lattice-preferred orientation of olivine which is caused by deformations in the mantle. The depth interval responsible for anisotropy is unknown but the data suggest that it may reach at least 300 km. The fast directions in SKS do not show clear correlation with the fast directions of the teleseismic P at the same seismograph stations.In the regions of present-day convergence the fast direction of anisotropy usually aligns with the plate boundary. This correlation implies that the direction of shortening is the same in the crust and the upper mantle. In the regions of rifting, the inferred direction of mantle flow usually aligns with the direction of extension in the crust.Outside the regions of recent tectonic activity we, most likely, observe a combined effect of frozen anisotropy in the subcrustal lithosphere and of recently formed anisotropy in the asthenosphere. On a global scale, in these regions there is a positive correlation between the absolute plate velocity directions and the fast directions of anisotropy. The correlation is especially strong in central and eastern parts of North America. A clear absence of any evidence of large-scale azimuthal anisotropy in the data of long-range refraction profiling for the upper 100 km of the mantle of that region implies that the effect in SKS is generated mainly at greater depths, in the asthenosphere. Orientation of olivine at these depths reflects recent and present-day flow in the mantle rather than processes of a distant geologic past.},

In previous studies attention has been given to P-wave data recorded in the marine environment, using either acoustic or elastic inversion schemes. In this paper we exploit both P-waves and mode-converted S-waves in the marine environment in the inversion for both P- and S-wave velocities by using wide-angle, multi-component, ocean-bottom cable seismic data. An elastic waveform inversion scheme operating in the time domain was used, allowing accurate modelling of the full wavefield, including the elastic amplitude variation with offset response of reflected arrivals and mode-converted events. A series of one- and two-dimensional synthetic examples are presented, demonstrating the ability to invert for and thereby to quantify both P- and S-wave velocities for different velocity models. In particular, for more realistic low velocity models, including a typically soft seabed, an effective strategy for inversion is proposed to exploit both P- and mode-converted PS-waves. Whilst P-wave events are exploited for inversion for P-wave velocity, examples show the contribution of both P- and PS-waves to the successful recovery of S-wave velocity.},

However seismological observations are usually explained with a higher order of symmetry using fewer parameters. We propose an analytical method to decompose the elastic tensor into a sum of orthogonal tensors belonging to the different symmetry classes. The method relies on a vectorial description of the elastic tensor. Any symmetry class constitutes a subspace of a class of lower symmetry and an orthogonal projection on this subspace removes the lower symmetry part. Orthogonal projectors on each higher symmetry class are given explicitly. In addition, the method provides optimal higher symmetry approximations, which allow us to decrease the number of independent parameters. Consequences of the symmetry approximation of the elastic tensor on shear wave splitting (SWS) are investigated for upper-mantle minerals (olivine and enstatite), natural samples and numerically deformed olivine aggregates. The orthorhombic part of the elastic tensor as well as the presence of enstatite are important second-order effects.},

  volume = {19},
  abstract = {Elastic Full Waveform Inversion (EFWI) is a computationally intensive method for iteratively estimating elastic subsurface model parameters. A cornerstone of EFWI is the numerical solution of the elastic wave equation, which is used as a tool to quantify the discrepancy between the synthetic (modelled) and true (real) measured seismic data at the receiver locations. The difference between the modelled and real recorded data is subsequently used to update the synthetic model to yield a better match between the modelled and true receiver data. A common approach to the EFWI problem is to use a non-linear conjugate gradient search method for the updates. The resolution and
cross-coupling for the estimated parameters can then be found by computing the Hessian matrix. For application to exploration seismic data, resolution of the estimated model parameters depend on the chosen parametrisation, acquisition geometry and temporal frequency range. Although some experience has been gained, it is still not clear which elastic parameters can be reliably estimated. Previous analyses, with some exception, have been based on simplistic arguments using radiation pattern analysis. We use a known adjoint-state technique to compute the Hessian for realistic exploration cases and analyse parameter resolution and cross-coupling for different selections of models, acquisition geometries and data types, including streamer and Ocean Bottom Seismic recordings. The information on resolution obtained from the exact Hessian is essential for evaluating the quality of estimated parameters due to the strong influence of source-receiver geometry and frequency content. For typical exploration type models and acquisition parameters unbiased estimates of pressure- and shear wave velocities can be obtained, but density appears to be coupled strongly to other
parameters.},

  abstract = {Quantitative imaging of the elastic properties of the subsurface at depth is essential for civil engineering applications and oil- and gas-reservoir characterization. A realistic synthetic example provides for an assessment of the potential and limits of 2D elastic full-waveform inversion (FWI) of wide-aperture seismic data for recovering high-resolution P- and S-wave velocity models of complex onshore structures. FWI of land data is challenging because of the increased nonlinearity introduced by free-surface effects such as the propagation of surface waves in the heterogeneous near-surface. Moreover, the short wavelengths of the shear wavefield require an accurate S-wave velocity starting model if low frequencies are unavailable in the data. We evaluated different multiscale strategies with the aim of mitigating the nonlinearities. Massively parallel full-waveform inversion was implemented in the frequency domain. The numerical optimization relies on a limited-memory quasi-Newton algorithm thatoutperforms the more classic preconditioned conjugate-gradient algorithm. The forward problem is based upon a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method on triangular mesh, which allows accurate modeling of free-surface effects. Sequential inversions of increasing frequencies define the most natural level of hierarchy in multiscale imaging. In the case of land data involving surface waves, the regularization introduced by hierarchical frequency inversions is not enough for adequate convergence of the inversion. A second level of hierarchy implemented with complex-valued frequencies is necessary and provides convergence of the inversion toward acceptable P- and S-wave velocity models. Among the possible strategies for sampling frequencies in the inversion, successive inversions of slightly overlapping frequency groups is the most reliable when compared to the more standard sequential inversion of single frequencies. This suggests that simultaneous inversion of multiple frequencies is critical when considering complex wave phenomena.},

  abstract = {Multiparameter elastic full waveform inversion (FWI) is a promising technology that allows inferences to be made on rock and fluid properties, which thus narrows the gap between seismic imaging and reservoir characterization. Here, we assess the feasibility of 2-D vertical transverse isotropic visco-elastic FWI of wide-aperture multicomponent ocean-bottom-cable data from the Valhall oil field. A key issue is to design a suitable hierarchical data-driven and model-driven FWI workflow, the aim of which is to reduce the nonlinearity of the FWI. This nonlinearity partly arises because the shear (S) wavespeed can have a limited influence on seismic data in marine environments. In a preliminary stage, visco-acoustic FWI of the hydrophone component is performed to build a compressional (P)-wave velocity model, a density model and a quality-factor model, which provide the necessary background models for the subsequent elastic inversion. During the elastic FWI, the P and S wavespeeds are jointly updated in two steps. First, the hydrophone data are inverted to mainly update the long-to-intermediate wavelengths of the S wavespeeds from the amplitude-versus-offset variations of the P\textendash{}P reflections. This S-wave velocity model is used as an improved starting model for the subsequent inversion of the better-resolving data recorded by the geophones. During these two steps, the P-wave velocity model is marginally updated, which supports the relevance of the visco-acoustic FWI results. Through seismic modelling, we show that the resulting visco-elastic model allows several P-to-S converted phases recorded on the horizontal-geophone component to be matched. Several elastic quantities, such as the Poisson ratio, and the ratio and product between the P and S wavespeeds, are inferred from the P-wave and S-wave velocity models. These attributes provide hints for the interpretation of an accumulation of gas below lithological barriers.},

  abstract = {An orthorhombic velocity model covers anisotropy and vertical/horizontal heterogeneity in the uniform 3D framework. It is important to define the azimuthal dependence of kinematic parameters of this model in the phase and group domains. I have derived equations for azimuthal dependent anellipticity in orthorhombic media and a simple equation to link the group and phase azimuths at zero horizontal slowness projection (zero offset). I found that the orthorhombic media cannot be treated as azimuthally dependent transversely isotropic media. To define the effective kinematic properties from a multilayered orthorhombic medium is a nontrivial task, and I have developed an approximate leastsquares solution for that problem. Numerical examples with the orthorhombic model and its special cases (a transversely isotropic model with vertical and horizontal symmetry axes and an elliptical isotropic model) were used to illustrate the effect of the individual orientation of symmetry planes on the effective kinematic properties.},

  abstract = {We have defined a group of new parameterizations for P-wave in acoustic orthorhombic (ORT) media with three cross-term normal moveout velocities and three cross-term anellipticity parameters. The corresponding perturbationbased approximations for traveltime in ORT model are developed using the new parameterizations. The perturbation coefficients are computed by solving the eikonal equation in corresponding parameterization. Eight types of parameterization are defined based on the different elliptical background model and selection of anellipticity parameters. As the traveltime can be converted from the group velocity inverse, the sensitivity of the group velocity inverse to anellipticity parameters is analyzed for different parameterizations and different range of offsets. To stabilize the perturbation series and improve the accuracy, the Shanks transform is applied. From the comparison of traveltime after the Shanks transform using different parameterizations, we have concluded that the parameterization with vertical, two horizontal velocities, and three cross-term anellipticity parameters results in the best accuracy of traveltime function for P-wave in acoustic ORT medium.},

  abstract = {Time-lapse full-waveform inversion has two major challenges. The first one is the reconstruction of a reference model (baseline model for most of approaches). The second is inversion for the time-lapse changes in the parameters. Common model approach is utilizing the information contained in all available data sets to build a better reference model for time lapse inversion. Differential (Double-difference) waveform inversion allows to reduce the artifacts introduced into estimates of time-lapse parameter changes by imperfect inversion for the baseline-reference model. We propose centered differential waveform inversion (CDWI) which combines these two approaches in order to benefit from both of their features. We apply minimum support regularization commonly used with electromagnetic methods of geophysical exploration. We test the CDWI method on synthetic dataset with random noise and show that, with Minimum support regularization, it provides better resolution of velocity changes than with total variation and Tikhonov regularizations in time-lapse full-waveform inversion.},

To apply the multi?source waveform inversion to marine streamer data, we use the global correlation between observed and modelled data as an alternative objective function. The new residual seismogram derived from the global correlation norm attenuates modelled data not supported by the configuration of observed data and thus, can be applied to multi?source waveform inversion of marine streamer data. We also show that the global correlation norm is theoretically the same as the least?square norm of the normalized wavefield. To efficiently calculate the gradient, our method employs a back?propagation algorithm similar to reverse?time migration based on the adjoint?state of the wave equation. In numerical examples, the multi?source waveform inversion using the global correlation norm results in better inversion results for marine streamer acquisition data than the conventional approach.},

  abstract = {The gradient of standard full-waveform inversion (FWI) attempts to map the residuals in the data to perturbations in the model. Such perturbations may include smooth background updates from the transmission components and high wavenumber updates from the reflection components. However, if we fix the reflection components using imaging, the gradient of what is referred to as reflected-waveform inversion (RWI) admits mainly transmission background-type updates. The drawback of existing RWI methods is that they lack an optimal image capable of producing reflections within the convex region of the optimization. Because the influence of velocity on the data was given mainly by its background (propagator) and perturbed (reflectivity) components, we have optimized both components simultaneously using a modified objective function. Specifically, we used an objective function that combined the data generated from a source using the background velocity, and that by the perturbed velocity through Born modeling, to fit the observed data. When the initial velocity was smooth, the data modeled from the source using the background velocity will mainly be reflection free, and most of the reflections were obtained from the image (perturbed velocity). As the background velocity becomes more accurate and can produce reflections, the role of the image will slowly diminish, and the update will be dominated by the standard FWI gradient to obtain high resolution. Because the objective function was quadratic with respect to the image, the inversion for the image was fast. To update the background velocity smoothly, we have combined different components of the gradient linearly through solving a small optimization problem. Application to the Marmousi model found that this method converged starting with a linearly increasing velocity, and with data free of frequencies below 4~Hz. Application to the 2014 Chevron Gulf of Mexico imaging challenge data set demonstrated the potential of the proposed method.},

  doi = {10.1093/gji/ggx549},
  abstract = {The Born approximation successfully linearizes seismic full waveform inversion if the background velocity is sufficiently accurate. When the background velocity is not known it can be estimated by using model scale separation methods. A frequently used technique is to separate the spatial scales of the model according to the scattering angles present in the data, by using either first- or second-order terms in the Born series. For example, the well-known `banana-donut' and the `rabbit ear' shaped kernels are, respectively, the first- and second-order Born terms in which at least one of the scattering events is associated with a large angle. Whichever term of the Born series is used, all such methods suffer from errors in the starting velocity model because all terms in the Born series assume that the background Green's function is known. An alternative approach to Born-based scale separation is to work in the model domain, for example, by Gaussian smoothing of the update vectors, or some other approach for separation by model wavenumbers. However such model domain methods are usually based on a strict separation in which only the low-wavenumber updates are retained. This implies that the scattered information in the data is not taken into account. This can lead to the inversion being trapped in a false (local) minimum when sharp features are updated incorrectly. In this study we propose a scaled-Sobolev pre-conditioning (SSP) of the updates to achieve a constrained scale separation in the model domain. The SSP is obtained by introducing a scaled Sobolev inner product (SSIP) into the measure of the gradient of the objective function with respect to the model parameters. This modified measure seeks reductions in the L2 norm of the spatial derivatives of the gradient without changing the objective function. The SSP does not rely on the Born prediction of scale based on scattering angles, and requires negligible extra computational cost per iteration. Synthetic examples from the Marmousi model show that the constrained scale separation using SSP is able to keep the background updates in the zone of attraction of the global minimum, in spite of using a poor starting model in which conventional methods fail.},

It is well recognized that a significant velocity change between the baseline and monitor survey introduces a time shift in the seismic data. Current practices are to apply time-shift analysis or to perform time-shift inversion to interpret such changes. These changes can be large enough that the background velocity model needs to be updated between the base and the monitor survey. Ideally if the velocity models can be estimated for both the base and monitor surveys, then these large changes can be interpreted. The FWI framework is ideally suited to accomplish this task.

  abstract = {The elastic orthorhombic assumption is one of the most practical Earth models that takes into account the horizontal anisotropic layering and vertical fracture network. In this model, the rotation angle of the vertical planes of symmetry is a crucial parameter needed to increase the convergence of an anisotropic full waveform inversion (FWI) as well as to provide the fracture geometry along azimuthal direction. As an initial step, we investigate the possibility of recovering the azimuth angle via FWI, which may offer high-resolution information. We first utilize our new parameterization with deviation parameters, which provides the opportunity for multi-stage FWI. Based on the radiation patterns and gradient directions of each parameter, we show that the azimuth angle mainly affects the parameters that have azimuth-dependent radiation patterns, so that we can hierarchically build up the subsurface model from isotropic to VTI to azimuthally rotated orthorhombic models with less trade-offs. From the numerical example for a synthetic 3D model, we expect that both a deviation parameter and the azimuth angle can be recovered in the last stage of FWI with minimum trade-offs.},

  abstract = {Traveltime-based inversions cannot solve for all of the anisotropy parameters for orthorhombic media. Vertical velocities cannot be recovered simultaneously with the dimensionless anisotropy parameters. Also, the density cannot be solved because it does not affect the normal moveout of P and S reflections. These limitations can be overcome using full-wavefield inversion for anisotropy parameters for orthorhombic media and for transversely isotropic media with vertical and horizontal symmetry axes. Tsvankin's parameters and the orientation of the local (anisotropic) coordinates are inverted from three-component, wide-azimuth data sets containing P reflected and PS converted waves. The inversions are performed in two steps. The first step uses only reflections from the top of an anisotropic layer, whichdoes not constrain the trade-offs between the vertical velocities, the anisotropies, and density, as shown by parameter correlation analysis. The results from the first step are refined by using them as the starting model for the second step, which fits reflections from the top and bottom of the layer. The properties of the target layer influence the amplitudes of top and bottom reflections as well as the traveltime of the bottom reflections; when all these data are used, the inversion is highly overdetermined and all model parameters are estimated accurately. When Gaussian noise is added, the inversion results are very similar to those for the noise-free data because only the coherent signal is fitted. The residual at convergence for the noisy data corresponds to the noise level. Concurrent inversion of data from multiple sources increases the azimuthal illumination of a target.},

  abstract = {In seismic full-waveform inversion (FWI), subsurface parameters are estimated by iteratively minimizing the difference between the modeled and the observed data. We have considered the problem of estimating the elastic constants of a fractured medium using multiparameter FWI and modeling naturally fractured reservoirs as equivalent anisotropic media. Multiparameter FWI, although promising, remains exposed to a range of challenges, one being the parameter crosstalk problem resulting from the overlap of Fr\'echet derivative wavefields. Parameter crosstalk is strongly influenced by the form of the scattering pattern for each parameter. We have derived 3D radiation patterns associated with scattering from a range of elastic constants in general anisotropic media. Then, we developed scattering patterns specific to a horizontal transverse isotropic (HTI) medium to draw conclusions about parameter crosstalk in FWI. Bare gradients exhibit crosstalk, as well as artifacts caused by doubly scattered energy in the data residuals. The role of the multiparameter Gauss-Newton (GN) Hessian in suppressing parameter crosstalk is revealed. We have found that the second-order term in the multiparameter Hessian, which is associated with multiparameter second-order scattering effects, can be constructed with the adjoint-state technique. We have examined the analytic scattering patterns for HTI media with a 2D numerical example. We have examined the roles played by the first- and second-order terms in multiparameter Hessian to suppress parameter crosstalk and second-order scattering artifacts numerically. We have also compared the multiparameter GN and full-Newton methods as methods for determining the elastic constants in HTI media with a two-block-layer model.},

  abstract = {The orthorhombic anisotropic description of Earth layers can allow the capture many of the Earth's anisotropic complexity. The inversion for high-resolution azimuthal variation of anisotropy is important for reservoir characterization, among other applications. A high-resolution description of the azimuth of fractures can help us predict flow preferences. To verify the feasibility of multi-parameter full waveform inversion for marine data assuming azimuthally rotated elastic orthorhombic media, we analyze the radiation patterns and gradient directions of orthorhombic parameters to the reflection data. We first express the gradient direction of the orthorhombic parameters considering the azimuthal rotation of the symmetric planes. Then, to support our observations in the gradient direction, the radiation patterns of the partial derivative wavefields from each parameter perturbation are also derived under the rotated elastic orthorhombic assumption. To find an optimal parameterization, we compare three different parameterizations: monoclinic, velocity-based and hierarchical parameterizations. Then, we suggest an optimal multi-stage update strategy by analyzing the behavior of the rotation angle as an FWI target. To analyze the trade-off among parameters in different parameterizations, we calculate the gradient direction from a hockey puck model, in which each parameter is perturbed at the different location on a horizontal layer. The trade-off analysis supports that the hierarchical parameterization provides us with more opportunities to build up subsurface models with less trade-off between parameters and less influence of the azimuthal rotation of orthorhombic anisotropy. The feasibility of the proposed FWI strategy is examined using synthetic marine streamer data from a simple 3D reservoir model with a fractured layer.},

  abstract = {Ultrasound (US) is a widely used modality for medical imaging, since it is non-invasive and relatively inexpensive. The ability of US imaging to detect internal structures, like tissue interfaces or lesion sites makes it a promising candidate for dental imaging. So far, the inherent technical difficulties of US imaging in tissues and organs with very heterogeneous (acoustic) properties and limited access have prevented its widespread use. In this study, we characterized the acoustic properties of sectioned teeth by scanning acoustic microscopy in reflection and transmission modes. The spatial distribution of sound velocity was measured in sections of extracted human teeth by use of a scanning acoustic microscope (SAM). Freshly extracted teeth were fixed in 4\% formaldehyde solution and embedded in a polymer block (PMMA). Sections of approximately 1 mm thickness were cut along the coronal-apical axis. Radio frequency (RF) data of teeth were collected in a scan region of 15 \&times; 15 mm\textsuperscript{2} by a SAM operating at 30 MHz with a lateral step size of 50 $\mathrm{\mu}$m and a sampling rate of 500 MSa/s. Sound velocity was determined from the time resolved reflection and transmission signals. Values for sound velocity from transmission mode were about 20\% lower than that from the reflection mode, if thickness information from reflection mode was used. If thickness was determined from the transmission mode, sound velocities from transmission were very close to those obtained from the reflection mode. Transmission mode is less sensitive to artifacts caused by the inclination of the specimen.},

  abstract = {Elastic Full Waveform Tomography (FWT) aims to reduce the misfit between recorded and modelled data, to deduce a very detailed model of elastic material parameters in the underground. The choice of the elastic model parameters to be inverted affects the convergence and quality of the reconstructed subsurface model. Using the Cross-Triangle-Squares (CTS) model three elastic parametrizations, Lam\'e parameters m1 = [$\lambda$, $\mu$, $\rho$], seismic velocities m2 = [Vp, Vs, $\rho$] and seismic impedances m3 = [Ip, Is, $\rho$] for far-offset reflection seismic acquisition geometries with explosive point sources and free-surface condition are studied. In each CTS model the three elastic parameters are assigned to three different geometrical objects that are spatially separated. The results of the CTS model study reveal a strong requirement of a sequential frequency inversion from low to high frequencies to reconstruct the density model. Using only high-frequency data, cross-talk artefacts have an influence on the quantitative reconstruction of the material parameters, while for a sequential frequency inversion only structural artefacts, representing the boundaries of different model parameters, are present. During the inversion, the Lam\'e parameters, seismic velocities and impedances could be reconstructed well. However, using the Lam\'e parametrization -artefacts are present in the $\lambda$ model, while similar artefacts are suppressed when using seismic velocities or impedances. The density inversion shows the largest ambiguity for all parametrizations. However, the artefacts are again more dominant, when using the Lam\'e parameters and suppressed for seismic velocity and impedance parametrization. The afore mentioned results are confirmed for a geologically more realistic modified Marmousi-II model. Using a conventional streamer acquisition geometry the P-velocity, S-velocity and density models of the subsurface were reconstructed successfully and are compared with the results of the Lam\'e parameter inversion.},

  abstract = {A constrained optimization type of numerical algorithm for removing noise from images is presented. The total variation of the image is minimized subject to constraints involving the statistics of the noise. The constraints are imposed using Lanrange multipliers. The solution is obtained using the gradient-projection method. This amounts to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold determined by the constraints. As t $\rightarrow$ $\infty$ the solution converges to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the image back onto the constraint set.},

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a technique which solves the ill-posed seismic inversion problem of fitting our model data to the measured ones from the field. FWI is capable of providing high-resolution estimates of the model, and of handling wave propagation of arbitrary complexity (visco-elastic, anisotropic); yet, it often fails to retrieve high-contrast geological structures, such as salt. One of the reasons for the FWI failure is that the updates at earlier iterations are too smooth to capture the sharp edges of the salt boundary. We compare several regularization approaches, which promote sharpness of the edges. Minimum gradient support (MGS) regularization focuses the inversion on blocky models, even more than the total variation (TV) does. However, both approaches try to invert undesirable high wavenumbers in the model too early for a model of complex structure. Therefore, we apply the Sobolev space norm as a regularizing term in order to maintain a balance between sharp and smooth updates in FWI. We demonstrate the application of these regularizations on a Marmousi model, enriched by a chunk of salt. The model turns out to be too complex in some parts to retrieve its full velocity distribution, yet the salt shape and contrast are retrieved.},

The algorithm is iterative and proceeds through the minimization of two cost functions. At the initial step the data are matched through the reconstruction of the radiating or minimum norm scattering currents; subsequent steps refine the nonradiating scattering currents and the material properties inside the scatterer. Two types of basis functions are constructed for the nonradiating currents: ``invisible'' (global) basis functions, which are appropriate for discrete measurements and nonradiating (local) basis functions, which are useful in studying the limit of continuous measurements. Reconstructions of square cylinders from multiple source receiver measurements at a single frequency show that the method can handle large contrasts in material properties.},

Moreover, even if the radial structure of the source is known apart from a constant amplitude and a finite radius, it is not possible to evaluate those two unknowns independently.

  shorttitle = {{{LDMNet}}},
  abstract = {Deep neural networks have proved very successful on archetypal tasks for which large training sets are available, but when the training data are scarce, their performance suffers from overfitting. Many existing methods of reducing overfitting are data-independent, and their efficacy is often limited when the training set is very small. Data-dependent regularizations are mostly motivated by the observation that data of interest lie close to a manifold, which is typically hard to parametrize explicitly and often requires human input of tangent vectors. These methods typically only focus on the geometry of the input data, and do not necessarily encourage the networks to produce geometrically meaningful features. To resolve this, we propose a new framework, the Low-Dimensional-Manifold-regularized neural Network (LDMNet), which incorporates a feature regularization method that focuses on the geometry of both the input data and the output features. In LDMNet, we regularize the network by encouraging the combination of the input data and the output features to sample a collection of low dimensional manifolds, which are searched efficiently without explicit parametrization. To achieve this, we directly use the manifold dimension as a regularization term in a variational functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is a Laplace-Beltrami equation over a point cloud, which is solved by the point integral method without increasing the computational complexity. We demonstrate two benefits of LDMNet in the experiments. First, we show that LDMNet significantly outperforms widely-used network regularizers such as weight decay and DropOut. Second, we show that LDMNet can be designed to extract common features of an object imaged via different modalities, which proves to be very useful in real-world applications such as cross-spectral face recognition.},
