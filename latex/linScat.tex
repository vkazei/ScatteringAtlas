\section{Wavenumber illumination theory}
In the previous section, we discussed the scattering of plane waves on point 
scatterers. But reflection-based radiation patterns can be 
remapped into the frequency-wavenumber domain in order to accommodate the scattering effects of any arbitrary perturbations that fit into the Born approximation.
%
\cite{ewald1969} spheres have been used to recognize the relation between illuminated wavenumbers in a perturbation and the directions of its incident and scattered waves in monochromatic plane-wave experiments. 
For example, \cite{devaney1984} used this 
method to quantify the resolution of geophysical diffraction tomography images in the
wavenumber domain. This technique was later applied to acoustic FWI scenarios 
for surface seismic acquisition \citep{mora1989} and vertical seismic profiling 
\citep{wu:11}. \cite{kazei2013gp} introduced the amplitude of the spectral 
sensitivity of the data to the perturbations of various background media, and applied it to models with diving waves and multiples \citep{kazei2015seg,kazei2013spectral}. An elastic isotropic-background case 
with VTI perturbations was considered by \cite{podgornova}. Here, we show the 
applicability of this technique to arbitrary anisotropic perturbations of isotropic media. 
%
% 
%The possibility of recovering a set of parameters is defined by the sensitivity 
%of the scattered wavefield to these parameters. Under the plane-wave 
%assumption, the resolution is straightforward for the wavenumber domain 
%representation of perturbation.
%For single wave mode we could compare reflection-based radiation patterns to 
%understand the coupling effects.


In this section, we provide a derivation of the 
scattering function and 
generalize it to spectral sensitivities 
\citep{kazei2013gp,podgornova,kazei2017}.
%
By incorporating the spectral sensitivities, we can consider a broad class of anomalies 
so small that we can neglect the second-order scattering. 
%
 

%For instance, mapping into wavenumber domain allows to consider 
%information 
%available for inversion from $P-P$ and $P-SV$ waves together.
